| 2.0          | Yoga            |
| 1.0          | Victoria        |

# Website

This website is built using [Docusaurus 2](https://docusaurus.io/), a modern
static website generator.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
This readme assumes that you already have node 14 or greater installed. To perform this install on Ubuntu, we run the following

```sh
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash
nvm install node
npm install --global yarn
```

### Install Dependencies
```sh
yarn
```

### Local Development

```sh
yarn start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window.
Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

### Build

```sh
yarn build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be
served using any static contents hosting service.

### Deployment

Using SSH:

```sh
USE_SSH=true yarn deploy
```

Not using SSH:

```sh
GIT_USER=<Your GitHub username> yarn deploy
```

If you are using GitHub pages for hosting, this command is a convenient way
to build the website and push to the `gh-pages` branch.
