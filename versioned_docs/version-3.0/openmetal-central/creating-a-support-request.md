# Creating a Support Request in OpenMetal Central

You can reach _OpenMetal Support_ for your technical, account-related, and
billing-related questions. Just create a _Support Request_ in the
_OpenMetal Central Portal._

## Submitting a Support Request

Through the **_Priority_** drop-down, you can relate to us if this request is
an emergency. Unless there is a support contract in place, our Support Team defines
an Emergency as
**a service disruption that impacts one or more physical servers or networks.**
We donâ€™t consider free trial request issues to be emergencies.

After you have populated the form, click _Send._ You will get a pop-up
confirmation.
