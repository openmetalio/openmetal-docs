# Getting Started with OpenStack Horizon

## Introduction

To get started with using your cloud, we introduce Horizon, OpenStack's
dashboard. It is accessible through a web browser and allows a user to
interact with the cloud. As an administrator, most of the cloud can be
managed this way.

## How to Log in to Horizon

The Horizon administrator password is present in a file within the cloud
itself. This section walks you through the steps required to obtain this
password.

### Step 1: Log in to OpenMetal Central

To get started, navigate to [OpenMetal Central](https://central.openmetal.io/)
and log in.

Click **Manage** to the right for the cloud you're working with to load
this cloud's details page.

You can obtain the admin user password for your clouds Horizon using the
**show password** button under **Access Details**.

You can also manually retrieve the Horizon password from the hardware node
manually, this method is detailed in **Step 4b**, If you wish to jump right in
proceed to **Step 5**.

#### Step 4b: Obtain Horizon Password Via SSH

During cloud creation, your SSH public key was added to each hardware
node. With this key, you are able to log in as root using SSH. To SSH
in, ensure you have one node's IP address and the private key on the
system you use to access your cloud. To find your cloud's hardware node
IP addresses, click **Assets** on the cloud's details page.

**Figure 4b:** Assets Page

The IP address for each node is listed under the **Public IP** column.
You can SSH into any of the nodes for this step. Select an IP from this
list, then use SSH to log in.

#### Requirements to SSH into a node

To SSH into a hardware node, ensure these requirements are met:

- Username: root
- Authentication: SSH key pair
- IP address of a hardware node

As an example, we demonstrate using SSH to log in to the first hardware
node, located by `173.231.254.165`. The SSH key file for this example is
`~/.ssh/id_rsa`. Ensure you specify the appropriate key and IP address
for this step.

For example:

    ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa root@173.231.254.165

Once logged in, search for `keystone_admin_password` inside of
`/etc/kolla/passwords.yml`.

For example:

    # grep keystone_admin_password /etc/kolla/passwords.yml
    keystone_admin_password: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

### Step 5: Log in to Horizon

You can now log in to Horizon using the credentials obtained from the
previous section. The username for the Horizon administrator account is
**admin**.
