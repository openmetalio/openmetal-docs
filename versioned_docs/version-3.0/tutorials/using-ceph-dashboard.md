In this guide, we will walk you through the process of managing a Ceph cluster
using the Ceph dashboard. Ceph is a powerful and highly scalable storage solution
 that is commonly used for object storage, offering efficient storage mechanics
  and robust data management capabilities. Let's dive into the details to explore
   the full potential of Ceph.

## Logging into the Ceph Dashboard

To get started, access the Ceph dashboard and log in with your administrator
 account. Credentials will be provided separately. Once logged in, you will
  see an overview of your cluster, providing you with key insights into its
   status and health.

## Cluster Overview

Ceph-only deployments are typically used for object storage, leveraging efficient
 storage mechanics that are ideal for large-scale data storage needs. In our example,
  we see that 5 percent of the cluster is pre-allocated. This pre-allocation means
   that the cluster is primed and ready for future data storage, providing a
    foundation for scalability.

## Exploring Cluster Hosts

Our cluster consists of four hosts: three control plane hosts and one
 dedicated storage host. You can inspect the physical disks used by the
  cluster. NVMe drives are employed for the database of file objects,
   which are then stored on slower media. This separation of high-speed
    and bulk storage ensures optimal performance and cost-efficiency.

### Physical Disk Inspection

By examining the physical disks, we gain valuable insights into the storage
 infrastructure. NVMe drives are known for their high-speed performance,
  making them ideal for database operations, while slower, larger capacity
   drives handle the bulk of data storage.

## Understanding OSD Partition Usage

One of the most crucial metrics in Ceph is OSD (Object Storage Daemon) partition
 usage. Ceph proactively manages storage capacity to prevent issues. Warnings
  are triggered at 85% usage, alerts at 90%, and the cluster goes read-only
  at 95% to protect data integrity. This proactive approach ensures that your
   data remains safe and accessible.

## User Management

Adding users to Ceph is straightforward. Just as you logged in with an admin
 account, additional users can be added via the dashboard or CLI. This
  flexibility allows for efficient management of access controls and user
   permissions. You can also set up alerts and upgrade your Ceph cluster
    directly from the dashboard to ensure it remains up-to-date with the
   latest features and security patches.

## Pools and Data Efficiency

Ceph allows the creation of different types of pools for data storage, each
 optimized for specific use cases. For instance, a replica of three means
  there are three copies of the same file, resulting in a 33% efficiency ratio.
   While this provides high redundancy, it consumes more storage.

### Erasure Coding for Object Storage

For object storage, erasure coding (3:1) offers a 75% efficiency ratio, allowing
 one host to go down without any data loss. This method balances efficiency with
  data protection, making it ideal for large-scale object storage solutions.

## Monitoring Pool Performance

Monitoring the performance of each pool in Ceph is essential for maintaining
 optimal operations. For example, when writing to an object storage pool, you
  can track metrics such as the amount of free space and data throughput.
   Enabling compression in pools can significantly enhance storage efficiency,
    as demonstrated by our example of a five-gigabyte text file compressed to
     just 441 megabytes.

## Setting Up S3 Object Storage

To use Ceph as an S3-compatible object storage solution, you need to create a
 user. In our example, we created a user named "OMI test" with S3 credentials.
  Using a tool like S3CMD, you can configure and interact with your S3 storage.
   This involves specifying the IP for the S3 endpoint, access key, and secret key.

### Configuring S3CMD

Once configured, you can create buckets and upload data. In our demonstration,
 we uploaded a picture of Neptune and a five-gigabyte text file. The text file
  was split into 250-megabyte chunks before uploading, showcasing Ceph's efficient
   handling of large files. S3CMD facilitates seamless interaction with the
    S3-compatible object storage, making data management intuitive and efficient.

## Accessing Uploaded Data

After uploading, you can set access control lists (ACLs) to make files publicly
 accessible. Using S3CMD, you can list the contents of your S3 storage and obtain
  direct URLs to access files over the internet. This feature is particularly
   useful for sharing data and integrating with other systems and services.

### Public Access Configuration

To make a file publicly accessible, set the appropriate ACLs. For example,
 setting `ACL public` on a file will generate a URL that can be accessed over
  the internet. This functionality is crucial for applications that require
   public data access, such as web services and content delivery networks.

## Conclusion

Ceph offers a robust and efficient solution for object storage, with comprehensive
 management capabilities through its dashboard. By following the steps outlined
  in this guide, you can effectively manage your Ceph cluster, ensure data integrity,
   and leverage advanced storage features. Ceph's flexibility, scalability,
    and efficiency make it an ideal choice for modern storage needs.

Whether you're managing a small-scale deployment or a large-scale data center,
 Ceph provides the tools and capabilities to meet your storage requirements.
  Embrace the power of Ceph and unlock the full potential of your storage infrastructure.
