# Creating OpenStack VM Images with ISO

Written by : Yuriy Shyyan & Ramon Grullon

ISO images in OpenStack function similarly to CD-ROMs and USBs in traditional
computing environments. They contain installation files and data for operating
systems and software, and users typically use ISOs to install them unto virtual machines.

This article will help you understand how you can install any ISO type media
onto an OpenStack volume to create singular installation or re-usable images for
Virtual Machine use.

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with [OpenStack Horizon](../users-manual/using-creating-images.md)

## Preparation

In this article we will use ISOs to create 3 VM images: PFSense, 3CX, and Fedora

This method can be applied to a variety of Operating Systems.

## Upload ISOs to Cloud

### ISO Context of OpenStack

Imagine that provisioning a VM using an ISO, is like plugging in a Live USB/CD
into a computer. This computer does NOT have a hard drive, the storage is ON THE
USB. This is a very special relationship when running image based virtual
machines. The storage that is part of the VM flavor is attributed to the Image.
In fact the data of the ISO loads in as the volume if you create the ISO based
VM. Instead of a USB/CD-ROM, it’s a full blown computer, with CPU, RAM and
storage (ISO storage).

First upload the ISO to your cloud / project. You can do this through
[Horizon](../users-manual/using-creating-images.md)

Uploading ISOs as the `Admin` user will allow you to share the ISO to be used by
all projects if selecting `Public` permissions.

![Image add](../tutorials/images/iso_images/horizon_image_add.png "Add Images")

For large images Horizon will not let you upload large images through the UI.
You may need to use the [OpenStack CLI](../users-manual/use-openstack-cli.md)
tool like so:

```bash
openstack image create --file Fedora-Workstation-Live-x86_64-39-1.5.iso --disk-format iso --public --progress "Fedora Workstation Live 39"
[=============================>] 100%

openstack image create --file debian-amd64-netinst-3cx.iso.1 --disk-format iso --public --progress "3cx-debian"
[=============================>] 100%

openstack image create --file pfSense-CE-2.7.2-RELEASE-amd64.iso --disk-format iso --public --progress "pfsense"
[=============================>] 100%
```

## Create ISO Virtual Machines

Understand that an ISO is technically just a ‘Drive’ that you can boot from, but
we need CPU and Memory to do that. So create a VM. There is no point to create a
volume from the ISO (It would be a direct copy of the contents of the ISO), we
want to run the Live CD/Installation Media from the image itself.

The flavor won’t matter either as these are just resources for the ISO and not
the future VM, pick something that will be powerful and fast.

_**AVOID USING FLAVORS WITH SWAP**_

Below is a link to documentation on creating flavors.

- [Flavor management](https://openmetal.io/docs/manuals/tutorials/manage-flavors)

### Select the ISO image during VM Creation

![Instance with Image](../tutorials/images/iso_images/horizon_create_instancewithimage1.png "Instance with Image")

Configure the VMs with the schema name ISO-vm - this is to represent that these
are not real VM, this is just us running the ISOs.

![List instances](../tutorials/images/iso_images/horizon_list_instances.png "List Instances")

## Create the Volumes (Drives to Install Software On)

What we will want to do is create a Virtual Hard drive that we will install the
 OS onto.

If you plan to reuse this image and the OS supports [cloud-init](https://github.com/canonical/cloud-init),
try to keep the volume to a minimal size, but if it cannot be expanded later
with cloud-init, set the appropriate storage size that you expect to be utilized
over the lifetime of the VM.

Create the Virtual Disks (Bootable drives) that we will install
the ISOs onto.

![Create volume](../tutorials/images/iso_images/horizon_create_volumes.png "Create Volume")

Create the volumes

![List volume](../tutorials/images/iso_images/horizon_list_volumes.png "List Volume")

## Attach Volume to ISO VM

Attach the Volume (Drive) to the running ISO VMs, so that we can
later through the installers - install onto these drives.

![Manage attachments](../tutorials/images/iso_images/horizon_manage_attachments.png "Manage Attachments")

Now we have attached Empty unformatted volumes (Drives) to our respective ISO VMs.

![List attachments](../tutorials/images/iso_images/horizon_list_attachments.png "List Attachments")

Linux OS systems have autodetection of media, but it is unlikely that the ISOs
do, go ahead and trigger a Hard Reboot for each of the VMs.

![Hard reboot](../tutorials/images/iso_images/hard_reboot.png "Hard Reboot")

## Install Software

Now go to Console for each and proceed with the installer. You will eventually
reach “Where to install” portion of the setup media like:

### PFSense

![PFSense install](../tutorials/images/iso_images/pfsense_install.png "PFSense Install")

![PFSense list drives](../tutorials/images/iso_images/pfsense_list_drives.png "PFSense List Drives")

![PFSense auto partition](../tutorials/images/iso_images/pfsense_auto_partition.png "PFSense Auto Partition")

### 3CX

![3cx list drives](../tutorials/images/iso_images/3cx_list_disk.png "3cx List Drives")

![3cx list partitions](../tutorials/images/iso_images/3cx_list_partitions.png "3cx List Partitions")

### Fedora Workstation

![Fedora list drives](../tutorials/images/iso_images/fedora_disk.png "Fedora List Drives")

![Fedora install complete](../tutorials/images/iso_images/fedora_install_complete.png "Fedora Install complete")

### Shut Down ISO VM

Typically, once the installation completes - you will be asked to reboot, or the
system will reboot automatically. That is fine, however remember that rebooting
will just boot back into the ISO causing you to go through the installation menus
again.

Shut down the ISO VM.

We have installed our media to the Volume.

Time to work with that directly.

![Shutdown instances](../tutorials/images/iso_images/shutdown_instances.png "Shutdown Instances")

Now that the ISO instances are shut off, detach the drives we installed the
media onto.

![Shutdown list instances](../tutorials/images/iso_images/shutdown_list.png "Shutdown List Instances")

## Detach and Configure Volumes

![Manage attachments](../tutorials/images/iso_images/manage_attachments.png "Manage Attachments")

![Detach attachments](../tutorials/images/iso_images/detach_attachments.png "Detach Attachments")

Make the volume bootable.

Click Edit Volume

![Make volume bootable](../tutorials/images/iso_images/make_volume_bootable.png "Make Volume bootable")

And check “Bootable”

![Bootable button](../tutorials/images/iso_images/bootable_button.png "Bootable Button")

## Use / Create the VM or VM Image

You’re almost done. Now you have two options.

- Utilize this exact volume for a VM.
- Create a reusable Image out of this VM.

### Create VM from Volume

- To use the Volume, when creating the instance you can select
Volume (The Drive) as the Boot Source:

![Instance with volume](../tutorials/images/iso_images/instancewithvolume.png "Instance with Volume")

![Fedora 39](../tutorials/images/iso_images/Fedora_splash_page.png "Fedora 39")

### Create Image and Provision from Image

- To Create a Reusable Image upload the volume into Images

![Volume to image](../tutorials/images/iso_images/volume_to_image.png "Volume to Image")

After the upload is complete, you can create VMs from that image.

![Upload image](../tutorials/images/iso_images/upload_image.png "Upload Image")

![Instance Fedora image](../tutorials/images/iso_images/instancefedoraimage.png "Instance Fedora Image")

When using the new image, your VM should boot normally unto your desired OS.

![Instance with image](../tutorials/images/iso_images/instancewithimage.png "Instance with Image")

ISO images in OpenStack function similarly to CD-ROMs and USBs and provide
a path to deploy functional instances and images for multi-use.
