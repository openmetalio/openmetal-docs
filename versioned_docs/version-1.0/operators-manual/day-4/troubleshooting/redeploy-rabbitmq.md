# How to Redeploy OpenStack's RabbitMQ Cluster using Kolla Ansible

## Introduction

As a last resort, it is possible to address issues with a cloud's
RabbitMQ cluster by redeploying the service using Kolla Ansible. In this
guide, we explain how to redeploy a private cloud's RabbitMQ cluster
using Kolla Ansible.

## Prerequisites

### Prepare Kolla Ansible

:::info New Clouds

On clouds provisioned **_after_ Dec 2022** you will need to open a
[support ticket](../../day-1/intro-to-openmetal-private-cloud.md#how-to-submit-a-support-ticket)
to have the configuration saved to your nodes.

:::

This guide explains how to configure your cloud using Kolla Ansible. Any
time you work with Kolla Ansible, you must prepare a shell environment.
For more, see [How to Prepare and Use Kolla Ansible](../kolla-ansible/prepare-kolla-ansible).

All commands are to be executed from the control plane node in which
Kolla Ansible has been prepared.

### Root Access to OpenStack Control Plane

Root access to your cloud's control plane nodes is required.

## How to Redeploy RabbitMQ

For each RabbitMQ cluster member, run:

    docker stop rabbitmq
    cp -Rv /var/lib/docker/volumes/rabbitmq/_data/mnesia{,.bk$(date +%F)}
    rm -rfv /var/lib/docker/volumes/rabbitmq/_data/mnesia/

Then, use Kolla Ansible's `deploy` function, targeting RabbitMQ:

    kolla-ansible -i /etc/fm-deploy/kolla-ansible-inventory deploy --tags rabbitmq
