# How to access the IPMI KVM console

## Objective

The main purpose of IPMI KVM is to facilitate remote server management,
troubleshooting, and maintenance tasks, providing administrators with a way to
interact with a server's operating system, BIOS, and other pre-boot environments
remotely.

## Requirements

- Access to [OpenMetal Central](https://central.openmetal.io/)
- Java is installed on your local machine.
  - To download and install the latest version of Java, click [java](https://www.java.com/en/download/).

:::caution
In order to access the IPMI of some legacy products you may need to adjust the
Java security settings to allow SHA1. In your downloaded copy of Java 8, open
the file lib/security/java.security and navigate to where
jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms is defined and change the denyAfter date
associated with SHA1:

```ini
# Before
jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, RSA keySize < 1024, \
      DSA keySize < 1024, include jdk.disabled.namedCurves, \
      SHA1 denyAfter 2019-01-01

# After
jdk.jar.disabledAlgorithms=MD2, MD5, RSA keySize < 1024, \
      DSA keySize < 1024, include jdk.disabled.namedCurves, \
      SHA1 denyAfter 2020-01-01
```

:::caution
Please bear in mind that while the IPMI Java applet can be utilized on macOS,
certain compatibility concerns may arise. Therefore, it is advisable to opt for
a system running either the Windows or Linux operating system for a smoother
experience.
