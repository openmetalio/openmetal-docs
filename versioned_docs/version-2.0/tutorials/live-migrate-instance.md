# How to Live Migrate an Instance Using Horizon

In this guide, we explain how to live migrate an instance using Horizon.

## Procedure

To live migrate an instance, first login to Horizon as a user with the
administrator role.

Next, navigate on the left to **Admin -\> Compute -\> Instances**. This
view shows you all instances for the currently selected project and
allows you to perform administrative functions, such as live migrating
instances.

This images shows an example of how this section appears:

The **Host** column indicates the hardware node from which an instance
is hosted.

Choose the instance you're migrating and from its drop down on the
right, select the option for "Live Migrate Instance".

The following form appears:

You can either have the system determine a host or choose one from the
drop down. Submit the form to live migrate the instance.

Private Cloud Core clouds are running Ceph as a shared storage backend,
in which the instance data lives. The options in the form for **Block
Migration** and **Disk Over Commit** do not apply to clouds using shared
storage. These options are used if instance data is stored locally on
the hardware nodes.

## Migration Status

Back in the instance listing, you will see an indicator the instance is
being migrated.

If the migration succeeded you will see a different host under the
**Host** column for the instance.
