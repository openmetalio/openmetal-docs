    ## Authentication

    All endpoints are secured using **Bearer Token Authentication**. To access the API, you need to include a valid token in the `Authorization` header of your requests.  
   
    Example:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
    ```
    Ensure that the token is kept secure and not shared publicly. Unauthorized requests will result in a `401 Unauthorized` response. 
    Please ask your OpenMetal account manager for a valid token. If you have trouble authenticating or accessing the API, please contact
    [support@openmetal.io](mailto:support@openmetal.io) for assistance.
