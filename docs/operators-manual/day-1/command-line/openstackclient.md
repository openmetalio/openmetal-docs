# How to Install and Use OpenStack's CLI

## Introduction

Your OpenMetal Private Cloud can not only be managed through a web
browser, but also through the command line using OpenStack's CLI called
OpenStackClient. Using the command line to manage your cloud introduces
more flexibility in automation tasks and can generally make an
administrator's life simpler. In this guide, we introduce you to the
command line method of managing your cloud by explaining how to install
and use OpenStackClient.

## How to Install OpenStackClient

### Prerequisites

- A Linux machine in which you can install OpenStackClient. This can
    be your own machine, the cloud's hardware nodes, or an instance
    running in the cloud.
- Python 3.6 or greater
- OpenStack RC file
- `clouds.yaml` file

### Install OpenStackClient

In this section, we demonstrate the initial preparation and installation
of OpenStackClient to the previously created **Jumpstation** CentOS 8
Stream instance.

#### Initial Preparation

Before installing OpenStackClient, you must obtain two files from
Horizon, which are required to prepare your shell environment. Those two
files are `clouds.yaml` and the OpenStack RC file.

- `clouds.yaml`: Used as a source of configuration for how to connect
    to a cloud
- OpenStack RC file: Used as a source of authentication for your user
    and project

To collect these files, log in to Horizon as your user. Navigate to
**Project -\> API Access** to download the OpenStack `clouds.yaml` and
the `OpenStack RC` files to your machine. When you navigate to **Project
-\> API Access** and collect these files, they are associated with the
current user and project that user is in.

**Figure 1:** API Access

This example acquires the `clouds.yaml` and OpenStack RC file for the
user **nick** and that user's primary project, **Development**.

#### Prepare and Install OpenStackClient

Next, use SSH to log in to the instance created previously. If you
created your instance by following the guide,
[How to Create an Instance in OpenStack Horizon](../horizon/create-first-instance),
then this instance can only be accessed from one of your control plane nodes.

-----

**Step 1**: Prepare `clouds.yaml` and OpenStack RC files

The `clouds.yaml` file obtained previously must be prepared in this
instance. For this demonstration, `clouds.yaml` is located as
`~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml` in this instance. Copy the contents of
`clouds.yaml` obtained from Horizon and store it as
`~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml`.

For example:

    # Create the following directory
    $ mkdir -p ~/.config/openstack
    
    # Copy clouds.yaml into this file
    $ vi ~/.config/openstack/clouds.yaml

**Note** -- The `clouds.yaml` file can be placed in several locations.
For more see the [Configuration Files](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/victoria/configuration/index.html#configuration-files)
heading of OpenStack Victoria's documentation.

Next, copy the contents of your OpenStack RC file, in our case called
`~/Development-openrc.sh`, into the instance. This file can be placed
anywhere and in this example, the file is stored in the `centos` user's
home directory.

For example:

    vi ~/Development-openrc.sh

**Step 2**: Create a Python virtual environment

This environment is created so as to not interfere with the system's
Python version.

In a default CentOS 8 Stream installation, the system's Python
executable is `/usr/libexec/platform-python` and is what will be used to
create the virtual environment.

Use `/usr/libexec/platform-python -m venv ~/venv` to create a virtual
environment in path `~/venv`.

For example:

    /usr/libexec/platform-python -m venv ~/venv

**Step 3**: Activate the Python virtual environment

Use `source ~/venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment.

For example:

    source ~/venv/bin/activate

**Step 4**: Upgrade `pip`

Before installing OpenStackClient and to aid in a smooth installation,
upgrade `pip`. Upgrade `pip` by using `pip install --upgrade pip`.

For example:

    pip install --upgrade pip

**Step 5**: Install OpenStackClient

With everything prepared, install OpenStackClient with:

    pip install openstackclient

**Step 6**: Activate User Authentication

The previously created openrc file is now used to set environment variables
related to authentication.

For example:

    $ source ~/Development-openrc.sh 
    Please enter your OpenStack Password for project Development as user dev-user:

**Step 7**: List servers associated with your project

For an initial command, list the servers associated with your project by
running `openstack server list`.

If your cloud is configured with a Self Signed certificate (our default)
you will need to pass the `--insecure` flag with your commands, otherwise
you will get a SSL Verify error due to the self signed certficiate.

For example:

    $ openstack --insecure server list
    +--------------------------------------+-------------+--------+----------------------------------------+--------------------------+----------+
    | ID                                   | Name        | Status | Networks                               | Image                    | Flavor   |
    +--------------------------------------+-------------+--------+----------------------------------------+--------------------------+----------+
    | 3bb6f079-90d3-4233-9400-94ef49c34a34 | Jumpstation | ACTIVE | Private=173.231.217.202, 192.168.0.200 | N/A (booted from volume) | m1.small |
    +--------------------------------------+-------------+--------+----------------------------------------+--------------------------+----------+

Here, we can see the server created in the previous guide.

## Command Structure

When using OpenStackClient, there is typically a common command pattern
for what you want to accomplish. All `openstack` commands begin with
`openstack`. You can execute `openstack` by itself to enter into a
shell, where commands no longer need to be prefixed by `openstack`:

    (venv) [root@lovely-ladybug ~]# openstack
    (openstack)

### List all Available Subcommands

Use `openstack --help` to list all available subcommands. You initially
see all the flags you can pass, but after scrolling a bit, the
subcommand list starts:

    Commands:
      access rule delete  Delete access rule(s)
      access rule list  List access rules
      access rule show  Display access rule details
      access token create  Create an access token
      acl delete  Delete ACLs for a secret or container as identified by its href. (py
    thon-barbicanclient)
    [...output truncated...]

### Learn more about a Subcommand

After seeing available commands, learn more about a command by using
`openstack help <command>`.

For example, to learn more about the `openstack server` command, use
`openstack help server`:

    $ openstack help server
    Command "server" matches:
      server add fixed ip
      server add floating ip
      server add network
      server add port
      server add security group
    [...output truncated...]

### List Items and Show Details

It is very common when using OpenStackClient to list items and the
command form is typically `openstack <subcommand> list`. For example,
`openstack server list`, lists all servers for the currently configured
project.

Furthermore, more information about an item can be found by typically
running `openstack <subcommand> show <item>`. For example, `openstack
server show Jumpstation` shows the details about the instance named
**Jumpstation**.

## Enable Bash Autocompletion

**Note** The required bash-completion package is not included in the
CentOS 8 Stream image resulting in an errors like the following:

    -bash: _get_comp_words_by_ref: command not found

We can install the missing package from the default repositories.:

    sudo dnf install bash-completion

By default, shell autocompletion is not enabled for the
`python-openstackclient` package. To view the autocompletion Bash
script, use `openstack complete`. To make the autocompletion persist,
store the output of `openstack complete` into
`/etc/bash_completion.d/osc.bash_completion` and reload your shell.

For example, we print the autocomplete configuration and redirect its
output to `/etc/bash_completion.d/osc.bash_completion` using `tee`:

    openstack complete | sudo tee /etc/bash_completion.d/osc.bash_completion > /dev/null

Next, either log out and back in to your shell or use `source` to load
the autocompletion script for your current shell.

For example:

    source /etc/bash_completion.d/osc.bash_completion
