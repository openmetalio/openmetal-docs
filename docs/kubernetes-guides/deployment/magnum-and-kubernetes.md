# Magnum and Kubernetes

## Introduction

Kubernetes in OpenStack is made possible by
[Magnum](https://docs.openstack.org/magnum/latest/user/), a container
orchestration engine service.

In this guide, you will learn how to deploy a Kubernetes cluster using
Horizon. The process this guide outlines is to first deploy the cluster,
confirm the creation of the cluster, and finally demonstrate working
with the Kubernetes cluster.

Get started by looking over the prerequisites required before the
cluster can be created.

-----

## Magnum Deployment Details

With Private Cloud Core OpenStack clouds, the deployment of Magnum
integrates with the [Kubernetes OpenStack Cloud Provider](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack).
Presently,
[release-1.18](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/tree/release-1.18)
of this repository is used.

The following items have been integrated:

- [OpenStack Cloud Controller Manager](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/blob/release-1.18/docs/using-openstack-cloud-controller-manager.md)
- [Octavia Ingress Controller](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/blob/release-1.18/docs/using-octavia-ingress-controller.md#deploy-octavia-ingress-controller-in-the-kubernetes-cluster)
- [Cinder CSI Plugin](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/blob/release-1.18/docs/using-cinder-csi-plugin.md)

For an example of how to set up load balancing, see
[Setting up HTTP Load Balancing with Ingress](https://github.com/kubernetes/cloud-provider-openstack/blob/release-1.18/docs/using-octavia-ingress-controller.md#setting-up-http-load-balancing-with-ingress).

## Prerequisites

This section explains what is required before creating a Kubernetes
cluster.

### Project Roles

To create a Kubernetes cluster, you must either be the `admin` user, own
the current project, or your user must have the "Load Balancer Admin"
role.

**Note** -- The "Load Balancer Admin" role appears as
`load-balancer_admin` in Horizon.

This guide uses the user `admin` and is working out of the default
`admin` project.

### Project Quotas

The project in which you are working needs to have enough resources
available to it.

For example, spinning up a cluster with three masters and three workers
using the `m1.small` flavor requires the following resources:

- 6 Instances
- 6 VCPUs
- 24GB RAM
- 150GB Volume space
- 1 Network
- 1 Router

To see current project quotas, navigate in Horizon to **Project -\>
Compute -\> Overview**.

To adjust project quotas, as a user with the `admin` role, navigate in
Horizon to **Identity -\> Projects**, find the project in the list, and
from the drop down on the right, choose **Modify Quotas**.

You can also set quotas to `-1` to allow unlimited of a resource type.

In this guide, the project's quotas are set to:

- Instances: -1
- VCPUs: -1
- RAM: -1
- Volumes: -1

### OpenStackClient

This guide assumes OpenStackClient has been installed and pointed to the
appropriate project. For information on how to install OpenStackClient,
see [How to Install and Use OpenStack's CLI](https://central.openmetal.io/documentation/operators-manual/how-to-install-and-use-openstack-s-cli/).

To confirm the cluster status using the command line, OpenStackClient
requires the Python package `python-magnumclient`.

Install this package using:

```sh
pip install python-magnumclient
```

## Procedure

### Create Kubernetes Cluster

To create a Kubernetes cluster, navigate in Horizon to **Project -\>
Container Infra -\> Clusters**, and follow the **Create Cluster** link.

-----

Fill the form sections out as outlined in the following steps.

**Step 1** -- Details

![image](../../tutorials/images/umx_kube_cluster_form_1.png)

Fill out the following fields:

- **Cluster Name** -- `kubernetes-demo`
- **Cluster Template** -- `kubernetes-v1.18.2`
- **Keypair** -- Your SSH key

**Step 2** -- Size

![image](../../tutorials/images/umx_kube_cluster_form_2.png)

Fill out the following fields:

- **Number of Master Nodes**: 3
- **Flavor of Master Nodes**: `m1.small`
- **Number of Worker Nodes**: 3
- **Flavor of Worker Nodes**: `m1.small`

**Step 3** -- Network

![image](../../tutorials/images/umx_kube_cluster_form_3.png)

Fill out the following fields:

- **Enable Load Balancer for Master Nodes**: Ensure this is checked
- **Create New Network**: Ensure this is checked
- **Cluster API**: Ensure "Accessible on private network only" is
    selected

**Step 4** -- Create Cluster

You can now create the Kubernetes cluster. Allow 10 - 15 minutes for
cluster creation.

Once the form is submitted, you will be taken back to the cluster list
where you will see the cluster being created with **Status**,
`CREATE_IN_PROGRESS`:

![image](../../tutorials/images/umx_kube_create_in_progress.png)

## Check Status of the Kubernetes Cluster

This section explains how to check the status the Kubernetes cluster
using OpenStackClient.

### Prepare OpenStackClient

Before beginning, ensure OpenStackClient is installed and pointed to the
appropriate project.

### Install `python-magnumclient`

Next install Magnum's CLI, `python-magnumclient` using `pip`:

```sh
pip install python-magnumclient
```

### List Heat Stacks

Next, you will need to list the Heat stacks. This output includes the
Kubernetes stack created previously.

List Heat stacks using `openstack stack list`:

```sh
$ openstack stack list
+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+--------------------+----------------------+--------------+
| ID                                   | Stack Name                   | Stack Status       | Creation Time        | Updated Time |
+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+--------------------+----------------------+--------------+
| 545b100b-ba3c-4366-9d68-eca7b1df98b6 | kubernetes-demo-ojlnzq4w252q | CREATE_IN_PROGRESS | 2021-06-14T21:19:35Z | None         |
+--------------------------------------+------------------------------+--------------------+----------------------+--------------+
```

You should see the stack created previously appended with random
characters. In this example, the stack is named
`kubernetes-demo-ojlnzq4w252q`. Take note of the name as it will be used
in the next section.

OpenStack uses [Heat](https://docs.openstack.org/heat/latest/) for
template-based orchestration.

### Check deployment status

To check the status of the deployment, use
`openstack stack resourcelist <stack-name>`,
where `<stack-name>` is the name of the stack.

Check status of stack `kubernetes-demo-ojlnzq4w252q`:

```sh
$ openstack stack resource list kubernetes-demo-ojlnzq4w252q
+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------+----------------------+
| resource_name                 | physical_resource_id                 | resource_type                                                                        | resource_status    | updated_time         |

+-------------------------------+--------------------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------+----------------------+
```

Once the column **resource_status** reflects `CREATE_COMPLETE` for all
items, the Kubernetes deployment is done.

It will take around 10 to 15 minutes for everything to finish deploying.

Kubernetes deployed by Magnum is handled by a series of Heat stacks.

> **Note!** You cannot move on with this guide if the deployment is
> not completely finished.

## Test Kubernetes Cluster

Once the deployment is complete, you can test the Kubernetes cluster.
This section briefly explains how to do this.

-----

The following steps are all run in a local development, or testing,
environment and assumes OpenStackClient is installed and pointed to the
appropriate project.

1. Obtain a copy of `kubectl` and make it executable:

    ```sh
    curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
    chmod +x kubectl
    ```

1. Create testing directory:

    ```sh
    mkdir k8s-test
    ```

1. Obtain cluster configuration:

    ```sh
    openstack coe cluster config --dir k8s-test kubernetes-demo
    ```

1. Set the `KUBECONFIG` environment variable by executing the output of the
   previous step:

    ```sh
    export KUBECONFIG=/home/<user>/k8s-test/config
    ```

1. Interact with the cluster using `./kubectl get svc -A`.

For example:

```sh
$ ./kubectl get svc -A
NAMESPACE     NAME                            TYPE        CLUSTER-IP
EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                  AGE
default       kubernetes                      ClusterIP   10.254.0.1
<none>        443/TCP                  115m
kube-system   csi-cinder-controller-service   ClusterIP   10.254.98.104
<none>        12345/TCP                114m
kube-system   kube-dns                        ClusterIP   10.254.0.10
<none>        53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP   115m
```

## How to Resize a Kubernetes Cluster's Node Count

At present, there is an issue with resizing a Kubernetes cluster's node
count using Horizon. To perform this task, you must perform the action
over SSH using OpenStackClient.

### Resize Prerequisites

Before preparing OpenStackClient, ensure a user with the admin role is
associated with the project under which the Kubernetes cluster exists.
Next, download the OpenStack RC file for the appropriate project and
user. Finally, source this file to prepare your local shell.

This guide assumes OpenStackClient has been installed and pointed to the
appropriate project. For information on how to install OpenStackClient,
see [How to Install and Use OpenStack's CLI](https://central.openmetal.io/documentation/operators-manual/how-to-install-and-use-openstack-s-cli/).

In addition, `python-magnumclient` needs to be installed to work with
the Kubernetes cluster. This can be installed using `pip install
python-magnumclient`.

Once the environment is prepared, you can issue the command to resize
the cluster.

### Resize Procedure

To resize the cluster, you need to first list all clusters to get the
UUID.

For example:

```sh
openstack coe cluster list
```

From the above output, copy the cluster's UUID.

To resize a cluster to 3 nodes for example, use the following command,
where `<cluster-uuid>` should be replaced with the actual UUID:

```sh
openstack coe cluster resize <cluster-uuid> 3
```

### Troubleshooting

This section will be filled as common failure scenarios and solutions
are collected. For general troubleshooting see the [Magnum Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.openstack.org/magnum/latest/admin/troubleshooting-guide.html)
from OpenStack's documentation.
