            Please review this pull request for the OpenMetal documentation site and provide feedback on:
            
            **Documentation Quality:**
            - Grammar, spelling, and writing clarity
            - Consistent formatting and markdown structure
            - Logical organization and flow of content
            - Proper use of headings, links, and markdown syntax
            
            **SEO and URL Structure:**
            - CRITICAL: Check if any markdown files have been moved or renamed
            - If files were moved, verify that appropriate redirects have been added to docusaurus.config.js
            - Moving documentation files changes URLs and negatively impacts SEO without redirects
            - Check for broken internal links that may result from file moves
            
            **Content Organization:**
            - Verify new content fits logically within existing documentation structure
            - Check that sidebar configurations are updated if new sections are added
            - Ensure versioned content is placed in appropriate directories
            
            **Technical Implementation:**
            - Review any changes to Docusaurus configuration
            - Check API documentation changes for OpenAPI spec validity
            - Verify build scripts and markdown linting compliance
            
            **Review Process:**
            1. Use `gh pr diff` to examine all changes
            2. For any specific issues found in files, use inline comments with:
               ```bash
               gh api repos/openmetalio/openmetal-docs/pulls/$PR_NUMBER/comments --method POST \
                 --field body="[Issue description and suggested fix]" \
                 --field commit_id="[commit_sha]" \
                 --field path="[file_path]" \
                 --field line=[line_number]
               ```
            3. Use `gh pr comment` for overall summary and approval/request changes
            
            Use the repository's CLAUDE.md for guidance on project structure and conventions. Focus on maintaining high-quality, SEO-friendly documentation.
